#Bootstrap-based Layer-wise Refining for Causal Structure Learning

##Usage 

main.m is the main function of BLR


##Input:
data: the data matrix< br >
alpha: the significance level< br >
n: the number of sampled datasets< br >
varepsilon: the aggregation threshold< br >
maxK: the maximum size of conditioning set


####Output:
DAG: the learned directed acyclic graph
